               //-------service discovery
     Microserivices can run on multiple instances and can run on any port and ip address
     so to manage all the instances,port and ip addresses we use eureka server
In service discovery
after all the services register themselves with eureka server
all the services stores  copy of registry of all the services in its local storage
whenever any services call another service it search from its own local copy if not found
then go to eureka server to get the service's information to call
even if our eureka server goes down our services still can call another services
